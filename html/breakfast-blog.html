    <h2><em>The chronicles of a cat growing up in the big city</em></h2>
    <h3>December 2nd, 2015 6:04AM</h3>
    <p>The humans haven't woken yet. Brother doesn't seem worried, but I fear we have seen the last of the meager rations they provide.</p>
    <h3>December 2nd, 2015 6:45AM</h3>
    <p>The male finally woke, went on his way without acknowledging my plight.</p>
    <h3>December 2nd, 2015 7:45AM</h3>
    <p>Female woke, offered half can of Tuna type food, and small portion of dry kibble. I'm afraid this will be our last meal. Brother ate the juice from his share of the canned food, and then ate mine. The meat itself was adequate, but lacking without the juice.</p>
    <h3>December 2nd, 2015 8:30AM</h3>
    <p>No sign of the humans. Food is running low. Canned food is 80% finished, dry food roughly 50%.</p>
    <h3>December 2nd, 2015 11:15AM</h3>
    <p>Situation is getting more dire by the minute. The humans have not returned and our food stores ran dry an hour ago. I'm afraid this will be one of my last transmissions.</p>
    <h3>December 2nd, 2015 1:30PM</h3>
    <p>I was able to scrape a few more small morsels of dry kibble from beneath the feeding apparatus. This will have so suffice for now. I pray it gives me enough strength to forage for more food. Brother continues to seem disintersted and unphased by the situation. I'm afraid his condition has worsened far more than my own.</p>
    <h3>December 2nd, 2015 3:47PM</h3>
    <p>The male captor returned, again blind to my pleas. He and Brother have been playing their moronic "hunt" since he returned. Brother hasn't yet had the courage to demand the rations we are due by basic feline right. It is becoming more and more apparent with each passing moment and each painful shutter in my stomach that this foodless cage will become our grave.</p>
    <h3>December 2nd, 2015 5:45PM</h3>
    <p>Male human left, and returned again shortly thereafter with the female. Fortunately she saw fit to grace us with another meager portion of food. Half can and small bowl of kibble. Brother enthusiastically ate his portion and the finer cuts of mine. I'm afraid this will be our last meal.</p>
